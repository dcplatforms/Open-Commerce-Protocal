# Welcome to the Open Commerce Protocol Product Hub

Explore the SDK, API documentation, integration guides, and security best practices for building secure and efficient open commerce applications.

The Open Commerce Protocol (OCP) is an open-source SDK designed to revolutionize commerce enablement by providing a secure, tokenized payment system. It powers the Open Commerce Initiative (OCI), focusing on next-generation financial applications, particularly in "Agentic Commerce" and Web3-integrated wallets.

OCP transforms traditional payment processing into a dynamic commerce layer, enabling businesses and developers to create autonomous agents with predefined spending limits, authorized counterparties, and trustless automation.
